<h1>Animation</h1>
<p>There's a large selection of premade animations to use with the framework as well as a easy to use system for applying animations to elements in your project</p>
<p>Animation classes are added under the <code>anim</code> attribute. This method helps make it clear which elements have animations and which don't. The first part in the anim attribute should be the name</p>
