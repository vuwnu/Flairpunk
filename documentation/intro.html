<p>This is an introduction to the framework and it's documentation</p>
<h2>Framework Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>To keep this framework consistent, class names and variable names will all follow a set naming structure. This can be seen below, along with an explanation on how different characters are used</p>

<p>Underscores are used exclusively for adding spaces between words such as <code>dark_blue</code> or <code>space_evenly</code>. Dashes are used for linking parts of a name together, such as the property and the value you are setting</p>
